•We propose a hybrid model that combines the power of CNNs with other machine learning techniques.

•Hybrid models allow us to integrate the best features of multiple algorithms, achieving more robust classification results.

•CNN + SVM (Support Vector Machine) and CNN + LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
